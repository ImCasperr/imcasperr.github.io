                        <p>Hi, my name is Casper. Well not really though I dont give out my personal information on the internet. I am named Casper though because I am whiter then a lab rat. I started doing staffing in gaming about 4 years ago, and moderating discord servers for 1 year now. I have worked in so many servers with so many different rules that usually if im new to my server I have to go and print out a copy of the rules and I will keep a printed copy whenever im moderating. I have been doing management of gaming and discord servers too, though if you are interested in hiring me to setup a discord server for you then please note I never remake a current server, I always make a new one. </p><br>
                        <h2>Hire me (I recommend not doing so)</h2>
                        <p>I am willing to do contact work, I have quit gaming itself though so. I am still on discord though. For gaming servers, I dont work on small projects for free, mainly because I just dont have the time or care to deal with them for free, I do take larger server positions though with ease.</p>
